# ctypes bindings for LevelDB 

The existing three [LevelDB](http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/) interfaces ([py-leveldb](http://code.google.com/p/py-leveldb/), [cpy-leveldb](https://github.com/forhappy/cpy-leveldb), [plyvel](https://github.com/wbolster/plyvel/)) use the Python C API and compile Python modules that work with LevelDB's C++ interface. This Python module simply uses the ctypes library to LevelDB's C interface - making it more portable across Python implementations and easier to install and distribute. 

lvldb:

  - Python 2-3 compatible
  - supports get/put/delete (with standard read/write options)
  - supports bloom filters
  - supports leveldb LRU cache
  - allows for manual or automatic database closing (compare with py-leveldb)
  - provides write batches
  - provides iterators (full control of leveldb iteration, with additional idiomatic python iterator support)
  - provides prefix-based iteration (returns iterators that work as if all keys with a shared prefix had the prefix stripped and were dumped into their own database)
  - provides scoped sub-databases (presents a new database wrapper backed by an existing database with all keys prefixed by some prefix)
  - provides range iterators (for idioms like give me all keys between start and end)
  - provides an in-memory db implementation (for faster unit tests)
  - supports snapshots
  - fits in one file
  - requires no compilation

## Installation

  - This module is a single file - you can save and import it into your codebase directly or:
  - Install from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using pip:
  
  ```
    (envname) $ pip install lvldb
  ```

## Sample Usage

```
# Python3
import lvldb

db = lvldb.DB("/path/to/db", create_if_missing=True)
db.put("key1", "value1")
db.put("key2", "value2")
print(f"key1 => {db.get('key1')} ")

for key, value in db:
    print(f"{key} => {value}")
```
